 Project Introduction: Invoice System (Prototype)
 
In today’s fast-paced digital world, efficient and organized billing is vital for any business—big or small. This Billing Management System prototype, titled "Loki’s Store", 
is a console-based C++ application that aims to streamline the sales and invoicing process through an interactive and user-friendly interface.

Designed with object-oriented programming principles, this project allows admins to:
*Add and manage customers and products (Electronics, Clothing, and Groceries)
*Generate itemized invoices dynamically
*Save and load data using file handling
*Provide secure access through a basic admin login system 

With modular class structures, clean I/O operations, and features like invoice generation, product categorization, 
and persistent data storage, this project showcases a practical implementation of core C++ concepts in real-world problem-solving.
Whether you're managing a small retail outlet or just learning system design, this prototype lays the groundwork for a scalable and customizable billing solution.
